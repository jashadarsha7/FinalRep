Burdwan is a large agricultural town with deep rooted cultural heritage and hectic business transactions. The school started from very humble beginnings and has reached great heights in every sphere of its activities.

Today it looks back, with satisfaction and pride at its remarkable achievements. It cannot forget what it owes to its great men and women of the past who dedicated their lives to accomplish what it is today.

When the students of the past take a trip down the memory lane, innumerable memories light up their minds. Their association with the school and experience of the past grip their entire life. Long cherished memories of the school guide every aspect of their lives. The reason for such intense emotional bond with the school is because their alma mater ensures that all the Xavierians receive training on all possible lines.
